# Rust-Basic-Algo
Simple algorithms implemented with Rust, as self-learning.

*Goal: a sorting a day until i finish chapter 2 of the book on sorting.*

All implemented are referencing from Algorithms 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne.

## Selection Sort
Find smallest item in the array and exchange it to the first entry. Repeat to the next smallest item and exchange with the second entry (since it will be the second smallest). Repeat until the whole array is sorted.

## Insertion Sort
Compare each entry starting from index 1, one to the left of itself, if the entry is greater than itself, swap entry. Otherwise move to the next entry. Repeat until the whole arrat is sorted.
